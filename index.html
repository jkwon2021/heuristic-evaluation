    <title>Heuristic evaluation</title>
</head>
<h1 class="section-heading">Visibility</h1>
<p><img src="facebook full page.png" alt="Facebook first homepage"></p>
<p>Visibility is almost perfect. I can see <strong>menu bar, my profile image, stories, birthday and contacts information</strong> at once.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Match between system and real world</h2>
<ul>
    <li>laungage : Perfectly translated from English to Korean(for Korean Facebook homepage). There is no awkward word </li> <p class="score">9/10</p>
    <li>words and phrases : There is no redundant words</li> <p class="score">10/10</p>
    <li>concepts familiar to the user : New design is little unfamiliar to me. Blue head line was more familiar to me.</li> <p>7/10</p>
    <li>natural and logical order : It is great.</li> <p>10/10</p>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">User control and freedom</h3> 
<p>There is no exit icon or emergency exit button. I am Mac OS user, so if I swipe to the right, I can go to the back page.</p> 

<h4 class="section-heading">Consistency and standards</h4>
<p>There is no different word, situation, or action that means same meaning.</p>

<h5 class="section-heading">Error Prevention</h5>
<p><img src="name change.png" alt="error message that shows at name change setting"></p>
<p>When I try to change my profile name, it got me a message that I cannot change name for the next 60 days. It is not pop-up messsage, so I can read carefully before tyring to change the name. It is shown in little blue background box.</p>

<h6 class="section-heading">Recognition</h6>
<p><img src="message.png" alt="message icon on the top right page."></p>
<p><img src="notification.png" alt="notification icon on the top right page."></p>
<p>Icon is more recognizable than word. The message icon is same as facebook message app, and notification icon is bell which has been used a lot for notification.</p>

<h7 class="section-heading">Flexibility and efficiency</h6>
<p>Instagram has quick action which is tapping twice for like the post. However, Facebook does not have one, no keyboard short cut nor macros neither.</p>

<h8 class="section-heading">Aesthetic and minimalist design</h8>
<p><img src="birthday.png" alt="birthday list in facebook page"></p>
<p><img src="contacts online.png" alt="contacts who is online and offline"></p>
<p>It is not minimalist design, but it is because it contains lot of information in one page such as birthday or contact list.</p>

<h9 class="section-heading">Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover</h9>
<p><img src="settings.png" alt="setting tabs in facebook page"></p>
<p>there is too many option tab in once.</p>

<h10 class="section-heading">Help</h10>
<p><img src="help.png" alt="help page"></p>
<p><img src="help center.png" alt="help center page"></p>
<p>It is easy to find help page and have many options to get help.</p>
